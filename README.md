# About-Me
Hello!!

This is Neemisa Das. I am a web developer currently working on the front-end.
I know languages like HTML,CSS,Javascript.
The languages which I want to learn presently is php, pyhton in Django framework.

I was assigned a task to learn about open sources,their need and how we can use them 
to polish ourselves. I did a small reseaerch on my part to firstly understand what it is 
all about.
